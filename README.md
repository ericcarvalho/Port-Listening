# Port-Listening chat GPT credit (this code was created by AI)

Welcome to my GitHub repository, Port-Listening!

To use this application, simply clone the repository and run the lportv2.py in yout IDE to view de code or run loportv2.exe to execute in a WindowsOS.
You'll need to specify the port on which you'd like to listen for incoming connections. Once the script is running, any telnet clients that attempt to connect to your server on that port will be automatically accepted and connected.

Feel free to use this application in your own projects, or contribute to its development. I welcome any and all feedback and contributions.
Thanks for checking out my project, and happy coding!
