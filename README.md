# Port-Listening

Welcome to my GitHub repository, Port-Listening!

Here, you'll find the code and documentation for my latest project: a Python application that listens for incoming telnet connections on a specified port. This application is designed to test connections to a remote server via telnet, without the need for any additional software or configuration.

To use this application, simply clone the repository and run the lportv2.py in yout IDE to view de code or run loportv2.exe to execute in a WindowsOS.
You'll need to specify the port on which you'd like to listen for incoming connections. Once the script is running, any telnet clients that attempt to connect to your server on that port will be automatically accepted and connected.

In the repository, you'll find the main Python script, as well as any supporting files or documentation. I've also included some sample code to help you get started, as well as detailed instructions for configuring and running the application.

Feel free to use this application in your own projects, or contribute to its development. I welcome any and all feedback and contributions.

Thanks for checking out my project, and happy coding!
